# taalf-runtime
TAALF (Trigger–Assess–Align–Legitimize–Feedback) governance workflow runtime.

This project provides an abstract, auditable workflow for handling change under uncertainty.
It is not a decision-making AI, but a governance runtime that ensures decisions can be
explained, reviewed, and revisited later.

## Philosophy

TAALF does not decide what is correct.  
It ensures that change is handled in a way that can be explained later.
